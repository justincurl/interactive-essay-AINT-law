    'The end state of AI diffusion can look very different depending on the institutional response. Some pathways lead to genuine improvements in access and efficiency; others simply make producing legal work cheaper without making it easier to achieve results clients want. Scholars have long emphasized the need for legal reform. By default, AI seems to be magnifying rather than solving these existing problems.',
    'For AI to deliver better outcomes for consumers, the legal industry must address all three bottlenecks. Otherwise, we risk a future where legal work becomes more abundant, but legal outcomes remain expensive and inaccessible.',
