  explanation: [
    'The end state of AI diffusion can look very different depending on the institutional response. Some pathways lead to genuine improvements in access and efficiency; others simply make producing legal work cheaper without making it easier to achieve results clients want. Scholars have long emphasized the need for legal reform. But by default, AI seems to be magnifying, not solving existing problems.',
    'For AI to deliver better outcomes for consumers, the legal industry must address all three bottlenecks. Otherwise, we risk a future where legal work becomes more abundant, but legal outcomes remain expensive and inaccessible.',

Such crises, jolts, shocks, and disruptive events—taking the form of social upheaval, technological disruption, or other changes—can reveal problems and contradictions that require solutions. Widespread predictions that AI will transform the practice of law may constitute such a crisis, creating pressure for legal institutions to respond.',
